# Bodhi Workshop #6

## Agent applications

In this workshop we will look at the process of agent application development. 

 

There are two tasks involved in creating mobile applications:

* creating web applications that run in the Bodhi mobile container
* branding the Bodhi mobile container



## Use Case

You will create an agent application that reads a CSV file and pushes the data to the Bodhi API.


##Prerequisites

**To run the app you need** 

* 
* 


## Create the simple type

A Bodhi agent app is a web application and consists of the following assets 





## Create a node.js project 





````
npm init

````

This will create a working folder on your machine and set the CLI to default to your namespace. 




To display all the apps currently deployed in the cloud for your specified environment enter:

```
app-tools list-apps [-e -n -u -p]
```

A list of apps currently in the cloud will be displayed. Each app entry will show its meta data. The list may be blank at the moment.


We will use more of the app-tools features during the next exercise.
