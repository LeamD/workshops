# Bodhi Workshop #5

## Push Notifications

In this workshop we will look at the process of mobile application development. 

 

There are two tasks involved in creating mobile applications:

* creating web applications that run in the Bodhi mobile container
* branding the Bodhi mobile container



## Demo Use Case

You will create a web application and deploy it to Bodhi Mobile.


##Prerequisites

**To run the app you need** 

* Bodhi Mobile installed on your ios or android device
* accepted Push Notifications for your device


## Create the simple type

A Bodhi mobile app is a web application and consists of the following assets 





## Create a node.js project 





````
npm init

````

This will create a working folder on your machine and set the CLI to default to your namespace. 




To display all the apps currently deployed in the cloud for your specified environment enter:

```
app-tools list-apps [-e -n -u -p]
```

A list of apps currently in the cloud will be displayed. Each app entry will show its meta data. The list may be blank at the moment.


We will use more of the app-tools features during the next exercise.


## Create a mobile app using bodhi-cli


We are going to use app-tools to created these assets for us. It should be noted that you can use any web assets. As long as key files are present and the correct package.json file exists you will be able to deploy applications to Bodhi Cloud.
